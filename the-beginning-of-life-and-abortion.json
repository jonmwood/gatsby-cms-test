It will also help answer questions about what to do with unwanted/unexpected babies from rape or incest, or whether or not it is acceptable to abort a baby to save the mother's life.  All those issues will not be fully and rightly understood apart from God's revelation about the origin and sanctity of human life. \n","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/bible-studies/parts/the-beginning-of-life-and-abortion.md","sha":"3196ae1c0ada3dfa5668054040bb43bba53e7d37"},"files":[{"path":"/static/img/1.-the-beginning-of-life-and-abortion.doc","sha":"9fb2a887929f1a80e62badd1470b9aa567af48ac"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-01-18T21:30:03.437Z"}
