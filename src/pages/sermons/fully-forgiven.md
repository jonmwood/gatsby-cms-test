# Passage - Hebrews 10

For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,

“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,
but a body have you prepared for me;
in burnt offerings and sin offerings
you have taken no pleasure.
Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,
as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’”


When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.

And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,

“This is the covenant that I will make with them
after those days, declares the Lord:
I will put my laws on their hearts,
and write them on their minds,”


then he adds,

“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”


Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.

Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.

For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again, “The Lord will judge his people.” It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one. Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. For,

“Yet a little while,
and the coming one will come and will not delay;
but my righteous one shall live by faith,
and if he shrinks back,
my soul has no pleasure in him.”


But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.




# Notes


**For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.**
- v.1
- We are reminded of our own sins when we hear of God's truth and go to church.
- Religiousness only help us remind us of our brokeness and are in need of fixing.
- We spend more time to hide the bad, make our worthlesness feel better and the guilt to go away more than we think. We have coping mechanisms to turn to.

1. **Busyness**: avoiding burdens by seeking entertainment or distractions.
2. **Shut down**: avoid people and shut them out. Skipping out on work or school because I can't face the world.
3. **Self-punish**: 
    1. verbally: constantly repeating in our minds "I am that bad"
    2. self-sabotage: taking yourself out of the game in fear of failure or vulnerability. 
    3. physically: 
4. **Lash out** 
5. **Drown out**: substance abuse, sexual intimacy to fill the hole of worthlessness
6. **Make vows**: "I'll never do that again." as a way to redeem our fallenness
7. **Doing good**: charity work or serving others can make me feel better.

- Some of us have become so good and trained to deceive ourselves by recycling through different coping mechanisms.
    - We trust ourselves to pay for our own brokeness.

## How does God see me?
- God calls us to come to Him in our brokeness, yet we choose to stubbornly to cope and deal with it on our own. We are too prideful to think that we need God to help or save us.
- I might look good in front of people, but how do I look before a holy God?




**Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,**

```
“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,
but a body have you prepared for me;
in burnt offerings and sin offerings
you have taken no pleasure.
Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,
as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’”
```

**When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.**

**And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.**
- Those who trust in Jesus are forgiven for all time. He will remember our sins no more. 
    - “I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”
    - Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
    - God looks to Jesus' righteousness in our place

## If I believe in Jesus, how does God see me now?
- I am fully forgiven as His child, having peace with God and in relationship with my Heavenly Father. 

**And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying, “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on their minds,”**
- The Spirit reveals to me that as His child I will love what God loves as it's written on my heart and mind.
- We aren't to deny our sin, but to look at it with our Father, recognizing how it violates our relationship with Him, bringing it before Him. My sin caused Jesus to die, yet God still chooses to love me.
