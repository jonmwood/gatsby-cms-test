Outline

Intro

Being a new dad, I'm frequently asked what it's like and how it's been. The feeling of being a parent is truly indescribable because I honestly have no other life experience I can compare it to and it’s a rainbow of emotions and thoughts. Sorry!

Everyone talks about the physical effects (loss of sleep, freedom, time, constant laundry and bottles) and hardly mention the emotional and relational effects.

Maybe it’s to each their own and the physical was just that much more impressionable on them and I really am a robot that has been brought to life through my son.

He is a gift from God truly and God has used him to grow and stretch me emotionally and relationally. I nearly cried 4 times during Pat’s sermon last week.

Fatherhood has changed me, and I would say for the better.

When my friends hangout and we laugh together and joke around, it’s cool and fun. But when I see Logan laugh and smile, it somehow turns a bad day into good.

I'm filled with joy and pride when I see new developments. Small and insignificant things like lifting up his head, being able to roll and crawl, holding his own bottle.

I also try to imagine what his future will be like. I'm excited for new memories to be made, yet I like many other parents I'm concerned with how he will grow up in the world like it is today.

Last week Pat through Psalm 139, shared with us that we are God's masterpiece, and then this week on the news it’s another tragic or devastating story about some murder or sexual abuse investigation, and that’s just what’s reported to get us to click.

There’s tons of corruption whether it’s financial or political that it just never seems to end.

How can we be considered precious masterpieces of God when the wide majority of news is crime, death, and disaster?

It almost seems like either God is wrong about people or there's a contradiction about our nature in being wonderfully made.

There's a lot more in the Bible about how God sees us and being wonderfully made is just the beginning.

Remember this is a 6 part series so we have to take each week in context of the whole.

Today we will be in the Romans 3:9-20 to learn about how God sees us in our fallen nature.

Each of the main three points will begin with "God sees me as deeply fallen \_\_\_\_\_\_"

\===============================================================

God sees me as deeply fallen in my nature

As much as God sees me as fearfully and wonderfully made as His child, He ALSO sees me as deeply fallen in my nature.

I'll say it again. God sees me as deeply fallen in my nature

Just like how we are to see ourselves as fearfully and wonderfully made by God, we must first understand to some degree who God is. - Specifically what is God's nature and character.

God is all knowing, all powerful and everywhere, not bound by time, space, or physics. He’s outside of creation.

God is also a holy and righteous God.

Holy: set apart (from creation), unique, sacred and pure, above and beyond any created thing we know of.

Righteous: to be upright, innocent, faultless, wholly conformed to God’s will,

There are a lot of different voices and opinions about our nature and identity as human beings, which one will we listen to?

The lies about our nature we hear all the time

We are inherently good, we just need to keep evolving and progressing.

As long as we are net positive human beings in the end, we are good and have succeeded.

We say nobody's perfect, and though that is a true statement,

we use that as our excuse to defend ourselves to our immoral or unethical actions.

If no one is right, we can all be a little wrong. How much is a little?

SUBJECTIVITY ILLUSTRATION: As a teacher, I would pass out the syllabus on day 1 and everyone’s ready and excited to do well. I tell them I set the bar high because I’m preparing them not just for their next year, or college, or the AP Exam, but to be skilled lifelong learners. Solid writers, thinkers, problem solvers.

They don’t fully understand at that point. They just want the grades or scores and nod their heads in agreement.

First test comes around. Some students will say ah I could’ve done better.

Then as the semester progresses it evolves to, how come they got a higher score than me? Why does he have to be so hard? Why is he being so unfair, doesn’t he understand that other classes have it easier? I know he totally grades my work harder because he hates me.

Eventually it goes to

“As long as I get a high score, and others get what they deserve, I’m happy.

“he’s the worst, if I were the teacher I would never teach the class like him. I’d make it easy for everyone to get an A and there’d be no homework because I hate homework.

In the end, they just cared about the grade or score in comparison to one another, they failed to see what I was leading them towards despite me explicitly telling them.

In the same way, we demand that God to lower His standard and that He is unfair. We don't fully understand His nature, His heart or plans as to why His standard of righteousness is so high.

We think we know better. We complain and gossip with others of how we would do better. We don't care to listen to our Creator.

We don't care to ask why. We don't really want to understand, we just want it our way.

We’re not wrong, it’s God’s fault. He’s the guilty one.

God's truth about our nature

Romans 3:9-20

9 What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, 10 as it is written:

“None is righteous, no, not one;

11 no one understands;

\ no one seeks for God.

12 All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;

\ no one does good,

\ not even one.”

13 “Their throat is an open grave;

\ they use their tongues to deceive.”

“The venom of asps is under their lips.”

14 “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”

15 “Their feet are swift to shed blood;

16 in their paths are ruin and misery,

17 and the way of peace they have not known.”

18 “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”

19 Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. 20 For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.

When we read this passage, it's clear that the Bible describes all people as unrighteous, not even one.

We are not just a little wrong, but we are immensely wrong if we look at the heavy language used.

V.12 we have all become worthless, or useless losing our purpose, quite the opposite of wonderfully created

Let’s clarify how this is passage is true. We must assess ourselves according to who God is and His objective standard of righteousness and not our subjective standard.

What does it mean to sin against God and become deeply fallen in our nature?

Sin: to fail or miss the goal/destination, MORAL FAILURE, falling short of the goal God's standard and not our own

God's Law is summarized in the 10 commandments weren't just do's and don't commands. They were descriptions for God's people about the kind of people they ought to be, that they're to ultimately love God and to love others.

Some of us may have some theological understanding about the depravity of man or man’s sinful nature as it’s a very essential pillar of Christianity. However, it’s so important for us to step away from sin and human nature as concepts and step into our personal standing before a holy and righteous God.

We’ll now look at some of the context Paul is referring to in chapters 1 & 2 that leads to his conclusion that we just read in Romans 3

We can sin by Living immorally: According to Romans 1:18-32 (show 28-32?) non-Jews (all of us) suppress the truth of what is good and right in order to seek self-glory and satisfaction,

we worship and acknowledge creation (people, prosperity, popularity, health, intellect, materialism, community, ideologies, experiences, security, comfort, influence etc.) rather than God the Creator.

Without His Spirit convicting us, we pursue all kinds of immorality: covetousness, malice, envy, murder, deceit, gossip, slander, haters of God, arrogance, disobedience to parents and authority, we not only willingly do these things, but also give approval and praise those who do the same. We cheer them on so that we feel justified.

But we are not the judge who defines what's good or evil. God is. Our immorality is evidence of our fallen nature before God.

We sin and are fallen by Trusting our morality: Most of us here, if not all are from an Asian American background and upbringing. For the most part, especially if we've grown up in a Christian context, we can HONESTLY feel like we're not that bad. There were always people around me growing up that were "worse" than me. I mean I stayed away from drug use, gang violence, or even dropping out of school and "wasting my life". In the eyes of Asian parents and honestly in my flesh I can feel like I've at least avoided many of the terrible life destroying crimes that would land me in jail.

Like in my example, Romans 2:14 we naturally create laws or moral standards for ourselves and others. The moral rules that I create are based on my own preferences and values. They describe the fallen me and in this way I make myself God.

We even fall short of our own flawed standards. If we were to judge ourselves according to our own laws we would be guilty.

Examples: People who fight and disobey their parents and say I'll never treat my kid like that, guilty already and I'm only 6 months in.

People who lie or bend the truth to impress others are dishonest and shallow, guilty.

People who say they will do something, but never follow through aren't exaggerators, they're hypocrites. Well. that's me through and through. My wife Cat knows all too well.

According to Romans 2:15-16, even if we never knew God's law in detail, we have a conscience that affirms that these laws are written on our hearts and we cannot uphold them perfectly.

Trusting in our religiousness: Paul finishes Romans 2 describing Jews who have the benefit of knowing God's truth and commands, are ALSO guilty of sin and unrighteousness because they think that their outward obedience of circumcision and other practices are what makes them justified or good. But they still break God's law and to be righteous is to be perfectly obedient to God inwardly in our hearts.

For those of us who either have grown up in church or have been a believer for years, this example should hit close to home. It's easy to point to how few Sundays we've missed, how many people you've met or even prayed for, the amount of offering you've given, the hours you've accrued in small group or serving in different roles and say, I'm a faithful believer, all these actions are evidence of my faith, but do we trust in our Christian track record or Christ's righteous record gifted to us by His grace?

So leading up to our passage of Romans 3, Paul has concluded that all people are DEEPLY fallen by our behavior. In this passage he supports his point from multiple areas of the OT. Psalm 51, 14, 53, 5, 140, 10, 36, Proverbs 1, 3, Isaiah 59

The Scriptures written thousands of years ago has described our fallen nature accurately, starting from the Fall in Genesis 3. Throughout all of history and across all cultures and nations, our sins always existed and appear in the same ways no matter how much we progress or advance in our own eyes.

Because I'm sinful and fallen in nature, sin exists in my heart and affects EVERY part of me

In Romans 3:13-18 Paul graphically describes in detail the damage we have sustained because of sin.

I'm fearfully and wonderfully made, yet because of sin, I'm imperfect, flawed physically, intellectually, emotionally, relationally, and spiritually.

My fallen nature includes my values and taints I think is "good" and "right" and even what is "evil" and "wrong"

v. 13-14 points to how sin appears in our speech

The attitude behind our words are: malicious, impatient, bitter, unforgiving, arrogant, and deceptive.

v. 15-17 describes sin in our actions

our feet and direction of what we pursue, though literally it seems extreme, it is points to the destruction of self and others.

Every action that comes from me is corrupt and tainted with sin. Even when I’m spending time with my son, preparing for this sermon, good and honorable things are tainted by our fallen nature.

Though we currently may not be as wicked as we could ever be, our fallen nature has no limitations to every part of us.

v. 18 describes sin in our thoughts and attitudes in living life without fearing God.

To have no fear of God means that we have no restraint to our self-satisfying desires, and we want the gratification of every desire of our heart without the consequence.

We don't want the truth of God's righteousness and judgement to impede on our illusion of reality.

If we ignore God enough, our lack of acknowledgement of His holiness and totality eventually positions our hearts to never rightfully fear God at all.

v.19-20 God's Law reveals no person can ever fully obey or fulfill the Law.

Therefore, God's law is the clear and undeniable evidence against me that I have no excuse and am fully guilty that of falling short of God's standard of righteousness.

I have fallen from God’s wonderful design and purpose becoming useless. I am corrupt because I choose to satisfy myself at the expense of others. I have no defense and I am fully guilty of falling short of God’s holy and righteous standard. I even condemn myself by not following my own moral laws. My immorality condemns me, my morality nor religiousness cannot save me. Because of my sin I have earned God’s judgement and wrath.

God sees me as I am, and I am deeply fallen in my nature

\==================================================================

As my family has grown with Logan we’re learning how we want our family dynamics to be especially with our extended family. I have memories of my extended family being together, visiting my grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins almost every weekend, it was a full day affair the adults would be chattering over rounds of mahjong, and the kids attempting to beat the boss in mortal kombat on super nintendo.

It’d always be feast to feed usually 12 of us crammed around a long rectangular table. We’d get home late on Sunday nights and then looked forward to the next weekend.

Somewhere along in my middle/high school years we went over to my grandparents place less frequently, and then completely. My extended family didn’t feel like family anymore because they weren’t apart of my life for a good 8 or so years.

I didn’t know until maybe at the end of high school something happened that ended our weekend tradition, but especially broke the relationship and trust between my parents and grandparents.

I think we can relate that some of us have experienced a broken relationship at some point and we no longer talk or have a relationship with them anymore.

What I learned in part of what happened between my parents and grandparents was a disagreement over a rental property both sides had invested in. Now I think we can easily hear about that situation and say “oh it’s because it was an issue about money and that gets messy between family”,

but across our broken relationships, universally it isn’t the circumstances itself that divided us, it’s how we in our NATURE respond and react to those circumstances out of pride, selfishness, greed, anger, malice, bitterness, ignorance, unforgiveness, deceit, etc. that are all attitudes of the heart.

My family had a broken relationship of almost a decade of silence. I believe it’s because of how they reacted out of their sinful nature and kept these attitudes in their hearts for years. Its effects has carried into our lives even till today.

Another way God sees me as deeply fallen is: in my relationships

One consequence of my sin and fallen nature is my broken relationships, which points me to my own broken relationship with God that needs reconciliation.

Isaiah 59:1–2

Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, or his ear dull, that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.

Isaiah 53:6a

All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way

Transgression: breaking or violating the trust of others, betrayal of a relationship, AKA trespass

Two nations have a treaty or breaking of the agreement. (NK/SK signed, but not full)

Actions we do can be wrong, but what is the deeper consequence is the relationship and TRUST WITH the other person is broken

stealing from a neighbor, breaks trust

Lying to or slandering someone you know personally

Adultery is wrong in itself, but it absolutely breaks the trust between husb/wife

This is a recurring reality throughout history between God and His people that there’s a constant breaking of relationship.

In Romans 5:15, Paul uses the word trespass or transgression to describe death and condemnation to all men as the result of Adam's transgression.

Adam’s transgression broke man’s relationship with God, which is passed onto us and our fallen nature continues to betray God’s trust, further breaking our relationship with Him.

In addition to breaking our relationship with God, our sinful nature also affects two other relationships.

Sin affects how I see others and my relationship with them

Sin which is rooted in our desires makes us slaves to our selfish urges, we seek our own benefit at the expense of others causing relational breakdown.

Out of our pride and insecurity we see others as worse than us.

The type of people I tend to view as morally and spiritually inferior:

others who struggle with sins that we have never struggled with.

Drugs, violence, disobedience to authority

others who struggle with the similar/same sins as us

Addition to social media, mainstream entertainment, video games, idolatry of materialism and experiences.

“At least I’m not as bad as this person.”

Even as Christians, we all have our own belief system outside of God’s and like the Pharisees hold others to our standards.

As long as there are people worse than me, I should be free of judgement or condemnation because people should look at how bad they are before they @me.

Have you ever thought what if we went to church with a murderer, adulterer, corrupt politician, verbal or physical abuser? How would we see them or treat them?

Though we love the story of how Jesus was a hipster and hung out with tax collectors and prostitutes instead of the Pharisees, we don’t realize that we subconsciously become the Pharisees making unspoken legalistic opinions when we’re all fallen in our nature. Jesus called them out as hypocrites.

Seeing others as worse than us causes us to sin or transgress against them in our hearts. Eventually our reaction out of our fallen nature can and will break our relationship and trust with them.

Sin affects how I see myself and my relationship with myself

Out of our pride and insecurity we see others as better than us.

Self-loathing as Pat brought up last week is a real issue, I know many people who deeply struggle with this for years. Negative thoughts racing around in our heads, “God must hate me, FML, I’m unsaveable”

I feel like I have gone through seasons of depressions before and mental illness is trending like never before. Alongside some illnesses that are biological or psychological, the truth is that we are all spiritually ill.

We sometimes hate who we are because we want to love ourselves or to be loveable.

Even if we don’t blatantly struggle with self-loathing we can still love ourselves too much and be inward focused to the point we are overly consumed about every flaw or feature.

We become wonderfully self-made, by our own efforts and standards through our fallen nature.

Seeing others as better than us causes us to sin or transgress against God and ourselves of who He made us to be.

The longer I’ve been a Christian, I’m realizing more and more that the reason why I struggle so much to love God as I should, my wife and son and I should, my church as I should, is because I honestly love myself too much. I put myself first and in my fallen nature the sacrifice is sometimes too great. There’s a healthy to love yourself that honors God and others.

God summarizes His law to simply love Him with everything we have, and to love others like we love ourselves. It’s pretty simplistic, but will take our lifetimes to learn.

God sees me as I am, and I am deeply fallen in my relationships

\==========================================================

God sees me as deeply fallen before the Cross

I don’t know about you, but I’m filled with shame and humiliation when others especially my wife sees my sin. I don’t want to be seen as such a depraved and fallen person.

But with God, as much as I want to hide and hope that He wasn’t paying attention to my sin today and He was busy dealing with worse sinners than me, He knows and sees it all including the sins we are enslaved to that others don’t see in fullness going on in our hearts and minds. He even knows of sin that we will commit.

Like Psalm 139 last week, God’s face and presence was everywhere David was. It feels like we’re always trapped or being watched 24/7.

If He were to just distantly watch us wallow in our fallen nature turning His back because we broke our relationship and trust with Him, that’d be so sadistic.

But in Psalm 139:17-18 David has a realization:

How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!

\ How vast is the sum of them!

18 If I would count them, they are more than the sand.

\ I awake, and I am still with you.

As a new parent, one of the craziest life changes for me is that I’m constantly thinking about Logan. Being married to another adult, you think about them sometimes, but it’s entirely different when it’s your child who is weak, dependent on you, who cannot help nor sustain himself. I know he needs me and I want to provide everything he needs at least as much as I can.

I don’t want Logan to see that I’m a quick relief for him just in that moment of need, but that he will learn that he can come to me with anything.

David realizes that God is like a father who thinks about us attentively, but is intentionally and infinitely more than a human father. He patiently pursues us, giving us Himself to depend on, and find help, strength, and comfort.

Though guilty, corrupt, and useless before the law, we have worth in the eyes of God as he sacrificed Himself on the Cross to pay for ALL our sin, past, present, and future.

We need to respond in coming before Him in confession and plea for grace and mercy.

It’s not that He needs to be aware that we did something behind His back.

Confession is:

a recognition that we have fallen short of God’s righteousness,

repenting that we need His help to turn away and transform our fallen nature to be more like His

genuinely wanting to restore our relationship and trust with Him again.

James 5:16- Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. (spiritually)

1 John 1:8-9 “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

9 What then? Am I any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all people are under sin, 10 as it is written:

“I am not righteous, no, not even me;

11 I don’t understand;

\ I don’t seek for God.

12 I have turned aside; and I have become worthless;

\ I do no good,

\ not even me.”

13 “My throat is an open grave;

\ I use their tongue to deceive.”

“The venom of asps is my their lips.”

14 “My mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”

15 “My feet are swift to shed blood;

16 in my paths are ruin and misery,

17 and the way of peace I have not known.”

18 “I have no fear of God before my eyes.”

Because I am deeply fallen in my nature and relationships, I am guilty without excuse, hopeless without help, and desperate under God's wrath, I have to look to Him for a solution to my shame and punishment.

God sees me as I am and I am deeply fallen before the Cross.
