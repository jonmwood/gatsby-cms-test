## Passage - Psalm 139

To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

O LORD, you have searched me and known me!
You know when I sit down and when I rise up;
you discern my thoughts from afar.
You search out my path and my lying down
and are acquainted with all my ways.
Even before a word is on my tongue,
behold, O LORD, you know it altogether.
You hem me in, behind and before,
and lay your hand upon me.
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
it is high; I cannot attain it.


Where shall I go from your Spirit?
Or where shall I flee from your presence?
If I ascend to heaven, you are there!
If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there!
If I take the wings of the morning
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
even there your hand shall lead me,
and your right hand shall hold me.
If I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me,
and the light about me be night,”
even the darkness is not dark to you;
the night is bright as the day,
for darkness is as light with you.


For you formed my inward parts;
you knitted me together in my mother's womb.
I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
Wonderful are your works;
my soul knows it very well.
My frame was not hidden from you,
when I was being made in secret,
intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
Your eyes saw my unformed substance;
in your book were written, every one of them,
the days that were formed for me,
when as yet there was none of them.


How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!
How vast is the sum of them!
If I would count them, they are more than the sand.
I awake, and I am still with you.


Oh that you would slay the wicked, O God!
O men of blood, depart from me!
They speak against you with malicious intent;
your enemies take your name in vain.
Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD?
And do I not loathe those who rise up against you?
I hate them with complete hatred;
I count them my enemies.


Search me, O God, and know my heart!
Try me and know my thoughts!
And see if there be any grievous way in me,
and lead me in the way everlasting!

(Psalm 139 ESV)




## Notes
- Self-awareness is a trending movement, which is important, but how does God see me? What kind of look does He give you?
  - We are listening to the wrong voices where there are many different opinions about you.
  - Is it weird to think that I am a precious son of God?
- Insecurity about who I am, especially my faults or comparing my gifting to others
  - "I hate myself" or "I hate how God has made me"
  - We look down upon those who are insecure

**How do you see yourself?**

- We have to start from a clear understanding of who God is in His omniscience, omnipotence, and holiness.
  - He knows us fully even the irrelevant and mundane moments.
- Wherever David is, God's face is there.
  - In some ways it's threatening to David because he feels exposed or not in control.
  - Depending on how you view the face of God, how do you feel comfortable towards someone who knows everything about you already.

- v.10 there's a shift in tone about how he was created.
  - being knitted is very personal and intimate
  - there's a reverence and awe in this creative work
  - we are the masterpiece of God
  - David praises and worships God for His wonderful works and includes himself as an example. He doesn't praise himself.
    - "All of God's works are wonderful, except me."
- self-loathing is not true humility
- David claims that in his soul he knows how wonderful God is very well. Do we know this very well?
- some of us are in despair and headed into darkness, but in v.11 David describes that God is light in the darkness
