# Passage
**Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.**
- Romans 8:35–39 

# Notes
- The Creator reveals the creation's purpose for creation cannot understand its meaning and purpose outside of its functions.
- God made us fearfully with exquisite attention to detail. As we are made in His image, He cares deeply about how we are made.
- As we are deeply fallen, we lose our purpose and usefulness that the Creator designed us with.
- We are fully forgiven through faith in Christ and was able to replace our falleness with a new identity.
- The question that still remains is "why would someone do this for me?" "how could someone do something so grand for me?"

- In the world, we believe that our worth is equivalent our net worth or value based on the world's standard.
- The Creator has stated our worth in action by dying for us. Heaven and hell are evidence of how much God cares about us and to be in relationship with us. 
    - Will I embrace the hold of my Creator or deny it?


**the LORD appeared to him from far away. I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you.**
- Jeremiah 31:3 
- I was never convinced that God initially loving me, how can I believe that He will continually love me eternally?
- In Jewish culture, 'everlasting' is not just future looking, but without beginning or end, eternal.
    - It has always been there and has no end.

**Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”**
- Jeremiah 1:4–5

**Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.**
