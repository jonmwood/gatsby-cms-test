# Passage - Ephesians 1:3-14


Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.

In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.

# Notes

- In a society where instant gratification is all we know, Christianity seems like an extremely costly lifestyle that God requires of us.
- The perception we may have is that this sacrificial lifestyle is not fun and tragically deprived because there is no sin.
    - This is a humanistic view.
- **We often ask is following Jesus worth it?**
- What will make someone happy?
    - Maslow's hierarchy of needs:
        - Physiological (Basic)
        - Safety (Basic)
        - Belongingness and love (Psychological)
        - Esteem (Psychological)
            - prestige and feeling of accomplishment
        - Self-actualization (Self-fulfillment) 
            - achieving one's full potential, creative activities


**Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing**
- We praise God because He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in Christ. 
    - This is in past tense.
- Though reading this passage, I don't really feel blessed as I'm described to be. My understanding of blessing is through a humanistic view, wrestling with the tension of sin and struggle.
- Our salvation
    - In the past, God foreknew and predestined His call for each of us. (justification)
    - In the present, we're currently being transformed to be more Christlike. (sanctification)
    - In the future, when we die we will be judged and deemed righteous because of Christ's work, and given new bodies. (glorification)
- Our spiritual blessings are different from earthly blessings, as they cannot be destroyed by moth or rust and will be held throughout eternity.
    - Physiological needs:
        - **“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.**
            - John 3:16
        -  **Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.**
            -  Matthew 6:31–33
    - Safety needs:
        - **Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”**
            - Revelation 21:1–4
        - **Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.**
            - Philippians 4:11–13
    - Belonging needs:
        - **And they sang a new song, saying, “Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation, and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth.”**
            - Revelation 5:9–10
        - **For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit. which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.**
            - 1 Corinthians 12:12–13, 24-26
    - Esteem needs:
        - **His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’**
            - Matthew 25:21
        - **They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat;for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labor in vain or bear children for calamity, for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD, and their descendants with them. Before they call I will answer; while they are yet speaking I will hear. The wolf and the lamb shall graze together; the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain,” says the LORD.**
            - Isaiah 65:21–25
        - **To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.**
            - 1 Corinthians 12:7–11
            - We are equipped to bless others around us instead of blessing ourselves.
        - Whose approval matters or means more to us someone who respect or God's?
        - The world cannot
    - Self-actualization:
        - **There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory. So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.**
            - 1 Corinthians 15:40–43
        - **I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.**
            - Galatians 2:20
            - Christ-actualization over self-actualization
- Every spiritual blessing is uncursed and eternal

**When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.**
- John 17:1–3
- Jesus describes eternal life not as a duration, but a quality of life that begins in the present.

- God says that it's worth it for us to trust in Jesus because we are given every spiritual blessing. You are not tragically deprived, but greatly blessed. This cannot be found in the world, only in Jesus.
