title: The Beginning of Life and Abortion
description: >
  Understanding where life begins is critical to making godly decisions about
  ethical issues such as abortion, embryonic stem cell research, and fetal
  tissue transplantation.  It will also help answer questions about what to do
  with unwanted/unexpected babies from rape or incest, or whether or not it is
  acceptable to abort a baby to save the mother's life.  All those issues will
  not be fully and rightly understood apart from God's revelation about the
  origin and sanctity of human life.

> _Note: There are a lot of passages to look up in this lesson.  I recommend assigning each passage to a different student in the beginning so that they open their Bibles to the right chapter, and then when the question comes up, tell the student which verse(s) to read out loud for the group.  This will save you the time it takes for everyone to slip to the right references._

## THE IMAGE OF GOD

**1) Read Genesis 1:26-27.  What is significant about the creation of man, both male and female?**

We are made in the image of God.  (See Notes on IMAGE OF GOD.)

2) Read Genesis 2:7.  What physical ingredient was used to create man?  What spiritual ingredient was used to give him life?  Why is this important to our understanding?

It took the divine act of God breathing life into the physical material to bring it to life.  Any view of origins that does not affirm that humanity began through a special creative act of God is not biblical.

3) Read Acts 17:28, where the apostle Paul is speaking to the Areopagus (the ruling council in Athens).  How does this both exalt and humble our understanding of human life?

Being created by God exalts us in that we are not accidents of chemistry, and humbles us because God is sovereign and we do not rule over ourselves.

4) Read Genesis 9:6.  Only human beings bear the image of God--that is what makes us unique.  While humans may kill animals for sustenance, what is the reason that God states for not allowing humans to kill humans?  What does this tell us about the value of human life?

Being made in the image of God is protected by God as something sacred and precious.



## THE MURDER OF BABIES

5) Read Leviticus 18:21 and 20:2-5.  Describe God's reaction and feelings about sacrificing children to Molech--a false god who was pleased by the death of children. (See Ezek 16:20 for another example.)

(See Notes on KILLING UNBORN CHILDREN.)

6) Read Exodus 21:22-23.  How does God regard a child that is still in the womb?

God regards the unborn child as a human being, protected by law.  There is penalty for injuring the unborn child because it is a human, made in the image of God, with all the same sacred and precious value.  (See Notes on DISPUTE ON EXODUS 21:22-23.)

7) Read Luke 1:39-44 where two pregnant women meet: Mary, the mother of Jesus; and Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist.  How does the Scripture indicate to us that the unborn children are full human beings, despite the fact that they are still developing in the womb?

Luke ascribes emotion, volition, action, identity, value, and blessing to the unborn children.  



## CONCLUSION

8) Read Psalm 139:13-16.  God is involved with our creation from its very beginning--forming and knitting us together.  This only re-emphasizes the sacred and precious value of human life, beginning at its conception, continuing in its development, celebrated at its birth, cherished through its maturity, and finished through its life.

Based on the consistent testimony of God's Word, the unborn child should be protected as a person from the moment of conception.  A child does not lose its human value or identity simply based on its location (inside or outside the womb), size, level of dependence, or level of development.  There is not one set of morals for pre-born children versus children who have already been born.

(See Notes on HARD CASES.  Consider asking question about the HARD CASES and see if your students can apply their understanding to such situations.)



#### Supplemental Notes that you should NOT use to ask hard questions from to make students feel dumb:



## IMAGE OF GOD

The Bible never explains exactly what the "image of God" or God's "likeness" is.  Several interpretations have been suggested in the past: upright bodies, dominion over nature, rationality, righteousness (before the Fall), human capacities, relational nature between man and woman, responsibility and morality, and personhood.  Because the Hebrew words for "image" (tselem) and "likeness" (demut) denote similarity and representation, a combination of the above views is best: human beings are made in the image of God--meaning they are like God (in several ways) and represent Him on earth. 



## DISPUTE ON EXODUS 21:22-23

Some interpreters have suggested that this passage argues against the humanity of the unborn child.  Their reason is because the verb (in the NIV, "gives birth prematurely") is actually vague, literally meaning, "causes the child to come out."  Their interpretation is that the child is miscarried, and the perpetrator is fined and only punished if there is injury to the woman.  That is an awkwardly forced interpretation.

A more accurate understanding of the passage is that given by the NIV, where the perpetrator is punished for injury to the child.  The textual support for this is from the same phrase "causes the child to come out" (which the NIV states "gives birth prematurely").  The word "child" there is the Hebrew word yeled, which always refers to a baby that has been born.  The Hebrew word for "fetus" is golem and is not used here.  The original Hebrew wording considers the child a human baby, not a fetus that lacks human identity.  Also, the verb is yatsa' which always refers to live births, not miscarriages; the word, shakal, for miscarriage is not used here.  Finally, even if it were describing a miscarriage, the penalty for accidentally killing an unborn child in this way is punished by the death penalty--a penalty that is only given for intentional homicides to adults.  The unborn child is under greater protection than one who is already born, because accidentally causing an unborn child to die results in the death penalty, while accidentally causing an already-born child to die could escape penalty by fleeing to a city of refuge (Numbers 35:6).  The death of the unborn child is judged equally with that of taking a life.



## KILLING UNBORN CHILDREN

The king of Syria would "kill their young men with the sword and dash in piece their little ones and rip open their pregnant women" (2 Kings 8:12).  Amos also prophesied against the Ammonites because they "have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead."  Killing unborn children was always regarded by God as an atrocity of the utmost wickedness.  This demonstrates God's concern for the helpless and also proves that He holds unborn children as human beings, with human value and dignity and the image of God upon them.



## HARD CASES

1) Rape and Incest

What about children who are conceived from rape or incest?

First, every believer needs to respond with compassion to those affected by such sins.  This includes both the mother as well as the unborn child.  

Of course it is wrong to put a child to death after it is born.  Every human life must be protected.  But just because a child is not born yet does not mean it is okay to put it to death.  If it was wrong to kill it after birth, it is still wrong to kill it before birth.  The pre-born baby should be treated as a person, made in the image of God.

2) Embryonic Stem Cell Research

Embryonic stem cell research which involves creating human embryos to harvest their stem cells for medical use is the intentional creation and destruction of distinct, individual, tiny human lives.  There are other sources of stem cells that can and should be used instead, where removal of the cells does not harm a human being.

3) Abortion to Save the Mother's Life

If abortion is necessary to save the mother's life, it is important now to recognize that removing the unborn child is done only with the intention of saving the life of the mother--not with the intention of killing the child.  If the medical technology existed which could also save the child's life, that would be the course to take.  

But in this tragic case, the choice is between the loss of one life (the baby's) and the loss of two lives (the baby's and the mother's).  This would be the only situation in which abortion would be morally justifiable, as its intent is to save and to make the best of an extremely difficult situation.
